# MusicFile Synthesizer

This library provides a synthesizer for [MusicFile](https://github.com/improvising-dev/music-file). It can load instrument samples from a sound package and synthesize using the AudioContext.

Besides, it also provides a MusicFilePlayer to handle MusicFile multi-track playback.
